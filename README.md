  * _I always liked to create something or take part in the creation of something. From various lessons and exercises for football, to various colors and shapes of cars (detailing). After that, I liked how the application looks on phones and various websites. And I'm interested in how it's done. After it, I decided to turn to a friend (who works in IT). He advised me to take a course here.I decided to take this course to get my first job in IT. I plan to complete this course to the end, as I am not used to throwing tasks that are difficult to cope with. I'm sure everything will work out._
